# Wave-Particle Duality and Double-Slit Experiment

## Wave-Particle Duality

Wave-particle duality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, suggesting that particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This duality challenges classical physics notions, highlighting the probabilistic nature of quantum entities.

## The Double-Slit Experiment

The double-slit experiment is a cornerstone in quantum mechanics, demonstrating the wave-like behavior of particles. In this experiment, particles (such as electrons or photons) are directed towards a barrier with two slits. The resulting interference pattern observed on a screen behind the slits suggests wave-like behavior, even when particles are sent through one at a time. This phenomenon underscores the probabilistic nature of particles and their ability to interfere with themselves.

## Project: Simulated Wave and Particle Interference Patterns

In this project, I've simulated the wave and particle interference patterns reminiscent of the famous double-slit experiment. Using [insert your programming language and libraries/frameworks used], I've created visualizations that illustrate the intriguing phenomena observed in quantum mechanics.
